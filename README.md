## 🤖 My AI Usage

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot**: For code suggestions and boilerplate generation
- **ChatGPT**: For debugging assistance and code optimization
- **GitHub Copilot Chat**: For explaining complex code and suggesting improvements

### How I Used AI
1. **Boilerplate Generation**: Used Copilot to quickly generate common code patterns and API endpoints
2. **Test Writing**: Leveraged AI to create initial test cases which were then customized
3. **Debugging**: Used ChatGPT to help identify and fix complex bugs
4. **Code Optimization**: Got suggestions for improving performance and following best practices

### Impact on Workflow
AI tools significantly accelerated development by:
- Reducing time spent on repetitive code
- Helping identify edge cases in testing
- Providing instant documentation and explanations
- Suggesting more efficient algorithms and patterns
